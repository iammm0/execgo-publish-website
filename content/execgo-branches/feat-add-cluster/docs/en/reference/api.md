# API Reference (Index)

ExecGo exposes a small HTTP API for task submission and task lifecycle management:

- `POST /tasks`: submit a `TaskGraph` for async execution
- `GET /tasks/{id}`: fetch a single task state (`pending/running/success/failed/skipped`) plus `result` / `error`
- `GET /tasks`: list all tasks
- `DELETE /tasks/{id}`: delete a task from the state store
- `GET /health`: service health
- `GET /metrics`: basic execution metrics
